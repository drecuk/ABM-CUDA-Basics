Agent-Based Modelling Chapter Five: CUDA Basic Installation and Code

### Topic: Foundational CUDA for Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)
### Author: Eugene Ch'ng [Academic Blog](http://www.complexity.io/)
### Purpose: Prepared for the ERC Advanced Research Grant 'Lost Frontiers' Scalable Agent-Based Modelling Team Training.
### Audience: For students and researchers needing a quick approach to learning agent-based modelling foundation for C++ and OpenGL

## INTRODUCTION
The series of CUDA code follows the previous four chapters of ABM modelling with C++. The tutorial style of the code follows that of the previous chapters are is meant for learning and for equiping team members working in the ERC 'Lost Frontiers' Advanced Research Grant with the basics of working with parallelising agent interactions. 

The series of code will also be useful for developers and students intending to understand how to allocate memory, copy data, parallelise and distribute processes in CUDA devices.

The series of code blocks within each folder are listed below. I suggest that beginners go through the sequence of code and avoid skipping folders for a more thorough understanding of how everything comes together at the end.
